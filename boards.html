        3D Build Tools
        One of the most important skills of any maker is the ability to understand, design, and build a three-dimensional product. Whether that 
        design will ultimately take form via a 3D printer, CNC machine, or a more advanced manufacturing method, being able to intricately model 
        the shape and behavior of a component is critical in becoming an effective maker. In this course students will learn the key fundamentals of 
        3D design, including the history of computer aided design/build, key manufacturing methods used in industry, the use of case studies to 
        model and demonstrate rapid prototyping principles, and a number of physical deliverables printed via the University’s set of 3D printers.

        Introduction to Maker Studio
        Ideas evolve much more easily toward applications when they are given a physical form. Maker style technologies and techniques provide tools 
        and pathways for designers from any of University of Advancing Technology (UAT’s) programs to rapidly create versions of their ideas. 
        Intended for non-majors, this course provides an introduction into the use of the most common entry-level maker equipment to create props 
        and functional prototypes.

        DBM215 CREDITS: 3 PREREQUISITE(S): DBM100
        Prototyping Tools and Practices
        This course focuses on creating functional prototypes from digital models using a variety of tools, techniques and materials as students explore 
        the process of taking an idea from conception to a functional state. Students in this course will learn to use a variety of maker style tools 
        representing differing levels of complexity to generate complex prototypes. Prototypes will be based on 3D models, where materials, their 
        properties and their functional relationships with each other as a part of a working model play key roles in design decisions.

        Electromechanical Devices
        Articulated and mobile devices depend upon electromechanical components for their functionality. This course provides students an overview 
        of electromechanical devices, their appropriately matched applications and then gives students opportunities to incorporate them into project 
        builds.

        DBM360 CREDITS: 3 PREREQUISITE(S): RBT173
        Wearable Technologies
        Integrating digital technology that incorporates computing, display and Internet connectivity and is worn by humans is a rapidly emerging area 
        of technology interest. In this course, students will learn current technology trends and capacities for wearable technology and apply them in 
        completed projects.
